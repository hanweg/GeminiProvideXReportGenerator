**ODBC Configuration:**
- Properly configured ODBC DSN for your Sage 100 Advanced ProvideX database
- Valid database credentials managed through Windows ODBC
- Network connectivity to Sage 100 Advanced database server (if applicable)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. `dotnet build`
3. `dotnet run`

### Configuration
1. **API Key**: Enter your Google Gemini API key in the startup dialog
2. **Model Selection**: Click "Fetch Available Models" to load compatible Gemini models
   - Choose from models like Gemini 2.5 Flash (fast), Gemini 2.5 Pro (advanced), etc.
   - Default is Gemini 1.5 Pro if no models are fetched
3. **DSN Selection**: Choose your ProvideX ODBC Data Source Name (Configured in Windows ODBC Data Sources)
4. **Authentication**: The app will prompt for database credentials when needed (Reccomended to save credentials in Windows ODBC Data Source Administrator -> Configure)

## üí° How It Works

### Startup Flow
1. **Configuration Window**: Enter API key and select DSN
2. **Connection Validation**: Tests both Gemini API and database connections
3. **Main Interface**: Loads with Object Explorer showing available tables for mirroring

### AI Collaboration Workflow
```
User: "Find sales orders for customer XYZ"
  ‚Üì
Gemini: Mirrors relevant tables (SO_SalesOrderHeader, AR_Customer)
  ‚Üì
Gemini: Generates initial query
  ‚Üì
System: Executes query and provides results/errors to Gemini
  ‚Üì
Gemini: Automatically fixes syntax errors or data matching issues
  ‚Üì
System: Shows final results in grid
```

### Intelligent Error Handling
- **Syntax Errors**: Auto-detects SQL Server vs SQLite syntax issues
- **Empty Results**: Explores table data to find correct search criteria
- **Connection Issues**: Graceful fallback with helpful error messages
- **Data Mismatches**: Tries to use fuzzy matching and LIKE patterns when needed

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **MainWindow**: Primary UI with split-panel layout
- **GeminiService**: AI integration with context-aware messaging
- **OdbcService**: ProvideX database connectivity and operations
- **SqliteService**: In-memory SQLite database with mirroring logic

### Key Technologies
- **WPF**: Modern desktop UI framework
- **SQLite**: Fast in-memory database for queries
- **ODBC**: Legacy database connectivity
- **Google Gemini AI**: Advanced language model for SQL assistance
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking operations throughout

### Database Schema Handling

- **Type Mapping**: Converts ProvideX types to SQLite equivalents
- **Constraint Preservation**: Maintains primary keys and data constraints
- **Sample Data Caching**: Stores representative data for AI context

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Basic Table Mirroring
1. Right-click table in Object Explorer
2. Select "Mirror to SQLite"
3. Watch status indicator change to show mirrored

### Automatic Gemini table guessing and mirroring, followed by query generation and results printing / analysis

### AI-Assisted Queries (Enhanced Flow)
```
You: "Find the latest sales order to customer XYZ"
Gemini: I'll help you find that. Let me check the sales history tables.
        ACTION: MIRROR SO_SalesOrderHistoryHeader
        ACTION: MIRROR AR_Customer
System: [Mirrors tables automatically]
Gemini: Now let me explore the table structures.
        ACTION: EXPLORE SO_SalesOrderHistoryHeader
        ACTION: EXPLORE AR_Customer
System: [Shows table schemas]
System: üìã Tables ready. Asking Gemini to continue with the query...
Gemini: Perfect! I can see the table structure. Let me find that order.
        SELECT * FROM SO_SalesOrderHistoryHeader WHERE CustomerNo = 'XYZ'...
        ACTION: EXECUTE
System: [Query executes and shows results - no manual intervention needed!]
```

### Automatic Error Recovery
```
Gemini: SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Customers
System: "SQL syntax error - SQLite uses LIMIT not TOP"
Gemini: üîß Fixing SQL syntax error...
        SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 10
        ACTION: EXECUTE
System: [Executes successfully]
```

### Zero Results Investigation
```
System: Query executed successfully. 0 rows returned.
System: Query returned 0 rows. Exploring tables and asking Gemini to investigate...
Gemini: üîç Investigating why the query returned no results...
        Let me try with a LIKE pattern instead...
        SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%XYZ%'
        ACTION: EXECUTE
```

### Customizing AI Behavior
#### It is highly recommended to add commonly used Table and Column names to the system prompt, sample schema and data as well as natural language description of important relationships - also a good spot to put common pitfalls and what to avoid!
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí System Prompt...
2. Edit the prompt to customize Gemini's behavior
3. Save changes (stored in SystemPrompt.txt)
4. New conversations will use your custom prompt

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Action Commands
Gemini can trigger automatic actions:
- `ACTION: MIRROR tablename` - Mirror a table from ProvideX
- `ACTION: EXECUTE` - Execute the generated query
- `ACTION: EXPLORE tablename` - Show schema and sample data

### Context Awareness
Gemini has full visibility into:
- Current query in editor
- Table mirror status and row counts
- Recent query results and errors
- Complete conversation history
- Real-time schema information

### Performance Optimizations
- **In-Memory SQLite**: Fast query execution
- **Background Threading**: Non-blocking AI operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Tables mirrored only when needed
- **Conversation History Management**: Automatic context pruning

## üîí Security & Compliance

### Security Considerations
- **API Key Storage**: Google Gemini API keys are entered per session and not persisted to disk
- **Database Credentials**: Uses Windows ODBC credential management for secure authentication
- **Network Security**: All AI communications use HTTPS connections to Google APIs
- **Data Privacy**: Only database schemas and sample data are sent to AI initially, ### Results of Queries are sent as well - be cautious with sensitive data!
- **Local Processing**: Table mirroring occurs locally using in-memory SQLite

### Compliance Guidelines
- **Data Governance**: Ensure compliance with your organization's data governance policies
- **License Compliance**: Maintain compliance with all required software licenses
